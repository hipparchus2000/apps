## Test Execution Results

Run the test suite using `sheet.test.html` in a browser.

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. Range Bounds Validation (Fixed)
- **Issue**: When a single cell reference was provided for chart data, the code would create an end position that could exceed spreadsheet bounds (ROWS=50, COLS=26)
- **Fix**: Added bounds checking using `Math.min()` to ensure endPos stays within valid range
- **Location**: `getChartData()` function

### 2. Missing Bounds Validation in Loops (Fixed)
- **Issue**: Data collection loops didn't check if row/col indices were within bounds before accessing cells
- **Fix**: Added bounds checks in loops: `r < ROWS` and `col < COLS`
- **Location**: `getChartData()` function loops

### 3. Division by Zero in Line Chart (Fixed)
- **Issue**: When chart had only 1 data point, `pointSpacing` calculation would divide by zero: `(width - padding * 2) / (data.values.length - 1)`
- **Fix**: Added check for single data point case and handle it separately
- **Location**: `drawLineChart()` function

### 4. Empty Data Handling in Charts (Fixed)
- **Issue**: Bar and line charts didn't handle empty data arrays or all-zero values gracefully
- **Fix**: Added checks for empty arrays and zero/negative max values with appropriate error messages
- **Location**: `drawBarChart()` and `drawLineChart()` functions

### 5. Cell Reference Parsing Validation (Fixed)
- **Issue**: `parseCellRef()` didn't validate that parsed references were within spreadsheet bounds
- **Fix**: Added bounds validation and support check for multi-letter columns (currently only A-Z supported)
- **Location**: `parseCellRef()` function

### 6. Range Validation (Fixed)
- **Issue**: No validation that parsed ranges were within spreadsheet bounds before using them
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive bounds checking after parsing range
- **Location**: `getChartData()` function
